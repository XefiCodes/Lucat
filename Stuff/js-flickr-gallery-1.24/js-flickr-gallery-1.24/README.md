JsFlickrGallery 1.24
=============

JsFlickrGallery is a [Flickr](http://flickr.com) based gallery 
plugin for [jQuery (1.7+)](http://jquery.com) that doesn't require any server-side image fetching mechanisms due to 
[JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) usage. It features easy implementation and provides wide set of options 
for advanced customization, including automatic modal and pagination deployment.
